## Progression Strategy

### Weekly Progression:
- **Weeks 1-2:** Learn technique, maintain weight
- **Weeks 3-4:** Increase weight by 5-10% weekly
- **Weeks 5-6:** Vary reps between 10-15
- **Weeks 7-8:** Deload week (reduce weight by 20%)

### Weight Increases:
- Main movements (Squat, Deadlift): +5-10 lbs
- Accessory movements: +2.5-5 lbs
- Isolation exercises: +1-2.5 lbs

---
🍎
## Nutrition Guidelines

### For Muscle Growth:
- **Protein:** 0.8-1g per lb bodyweight (daily)
- **Carbohydrates:** Pre and post-workout
- **Water:** At least 1 gallon (3-4 liters) daily
- **Sleep:** 7-9 hours quality sleep

### Timing:
- **Pre-workout (1-2 hours):** Carbs + protein
- **Post-workout (within 30 min):** Protein shake + fast carbs
- **Evening:** Slow protein (casein)

---
⚠️
## Important Notes

1. **Technique first:** Proper form before heavy weight
2. **Warm-up mandatory:** Reduces injury risk
3. **Rest days:** Critical for muscle growth
4. **Progressive overload:** Gradually increase challenge
5. **Listen to your body:** Rest when overtrained
