## Purpose
Hamstring curls are an isolation exercise that target the hamstrings (biceps femoris, semitendinosus, semimembranosus) and help improve knee flexion strength, posterior chain balance, and muscular detail.

## Equipment
- Lying (prone) hamstring curl machine, seated hamstring curl machine, or cable with ankle attachment.

## Starting Position (lying machine)
- Lie face down on the bench with hips aligned to the machine pad pivot.
- Secure the lower leg pad just above the heels (around the Achilles). 
- Keep hips, torso and pelvis pressed into the bench; grip the handles lightly.
- Knees slightly off the edge so the range of motion is free.

## Movement
1. Inhale and brace the core.
2. Exhale and drive the heels toward the glutes by flexing the knees.
3. Pause 0.5–1s at the peak contraction while squeezing the hamstrings.
4. Slowly control the return to full knee extension (don’t fully lock if the machine allows continuous tension).

## Cues
- "Pull heels to glutes" (focus on heels, not toes).
- "Squeeze at the top" (peak contraction holds hypertrophy stimulus).
- Control the eccentric — make the lowering phase deliberate.

## Tempo & Programming
- Hypertrophy: 3–4 sets × 8–12 reps, 2–3s eccentric, 0.5–1s peak, moderate load.
- Strength: 3–5 sets × 4–6 reps (heavier, shorter range or paused reps).
- Endurance / rehab: 2–3 sets × 15–20 reps, lighter load, strict form.

## Variations
- Lying hamstring curl (machine) — classic, best isolation.
- Seated hamstring curl (machine) — emphasizes distal hamstring, more comfortable for some.
- Single‑leg hamstring curl — addresses imbalances; 3 sets × 8–12 reps/leg.
- Cable hamstring curl (ankle strap) — constant tension, portable option.
- Stability ball hamstring curl — bodyweight alternative for glute-hamstring chain.

## Common Mistakes
- Using hip extension to cheat (raising hips off bench) — keep hips pinned.
- Swinging or using momentum on the concentric — control both phases.
- Letting the knees move forward/back — keep axis aligned and stable.
- Using toes instead of heels — cue heel-driven pulls.

## Progressions & Variations for Overload
- Increase load gradually while maintaining tempo.
- Add slow eccentrics (3–4s down) for extra stimulus.
- Use single-leg sets or drop sets as finishers.
- Superset with Romanian deadlifts or glute-ham raises for posterior chain density.

## Safety & Notes
- Avoid heavy, uncontrolled loading if you have acute knee issues — prioritize pain-free range.
- Keep lower back neutral and hips stable; stop if you feel pinching in the front of the knee.

## Quick Program Example
- Main lower day accessory: 3 sets × 8–12 reps (seated or lying), 90s rest.
- If using as a finisher: 2 sets × 12–15 reps superset with glute bridge.
