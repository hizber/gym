## Primary Targets
**Main Muscles:** Hamstrings, Glutes, Lower Back, Erectors, Core

📋
### Exercise Overview
The Barbell Deadlift is a foundational posterior-chain compound lift excellent for building strength and muscle mass across the hamstrings, glutes, and lower back while demanding full‑body tension and core stability.

## Exercise Variations & Alternatives

### 1. **👑 Conventional Barbell Deadlift** (Recommended for general strength/hypertrophy)
**Equipment:** Barbell, plates
**Difficulty:** Intermediate | **Type:** Strength | **Primary:** Posterior Chain, Lower Back

**Technique:**
- Stand with feet hip-width under the bar, grip outside knees
- Hips back, chest up, shoulders slightly in front of the bar
- Brace core, drive feet into floor, extend hips and knees together
- Keep bar close to shins/thighs; finish standing tall with hip squeeze

**Benefits:**
- ✅ High whole-body tension and mechanical loading
- ✅ Excellent for hamstring, glute, and spinal erector development
- ✅ Transfers well to other strength movements

### 2. **🔥 Sumo Deadlift**
**Primary:** Glutes, Adductors, Quads, Lower Back

**Notes:** Wider stance, more hip-abducted; reduces range of motion and may suit lifters with longer torsos or limited hamstring mobility.

---

### 3. **🎯 Romanian Deadlift (RDL)**
**Primary:** Hamstrings, Glutes, Erectors

**Notes:** Hip-hinge dominant accessory for posterior chain hypertrophy; keep slight knee bend and emphasize eccentric control.

---

### 4. **⚡ Trap-Bar (Hex) Deadlift**
**Primary:** Quads, Glutes, Hamstrings, Lower Back

**Notes:** Neutral grip and more upright torso—good for reducing shear on lumbar spine and progressing loading safely.

---

### 5. **💡 Deficit Deadlift**
**Primary:** Hamstrings, Glutes, Lower Back

**Notes:** Standing on a small platform increases ROM and challenge off the floor; useful for improving starting strength.

---

### 6. **🤖 Stiff-Leg Deadlift (Light)**
**Primary:** Hamstrings, Glutes

**Notes:** For strict hamstring emphasis; use lighter loads and controlled tempo.

---

## Programming & Cues
- **Load & Reps:** For strength/hypertrophy: 2–4 sets × 3–6 reps (strength focus) or 2–4 sets × 6–8 reps (hypertrophy-focused heavy sets). Use RDL or single-leg variations for additional 8–12 rep accessory work.
- **Tempo:** Controlled eccentric, powerful concentric; avoid excessive lumbar flexion.
- **Progression:** Increase load when you can hit top of rep range with solid technique; alternate heavy and speed/volume sessions across the week.
- **Common Faults:** Rounded back, hips rising too fast, bar drifting away from body—reset setup, brace core, and lighten load if needed.

---

## Safety & Warm-up
- Warm up hips, hamstrings, and lats; perform progressive warm-up sets (e.g., empty bar × 8, 50% × 5, 70% × 3)
- Maintain neutral spine and a braced core
- Use straps or hook grip for heavy singles if grip is limiting
