## 📋 Programming Guidelines

### Beginner Program:
- **Sets:** 3-4
- **Reps:** 5-8 (assisted or knee-bent bench dips)
- **Progression:** Reduce assistance or extend legs further
- **Rest:** 90-120 seconds between sets
- **Focus:** Building basic strength and proper form

### Intermediate Program:
- **Sets:** 4-5
- **Reps:** 8-12
- **Weight:** Bodyweight or light added weight
- **Rest:** 2-3 minutes between sets
- **Focus:** Increasing rep range and movement quality

### Advanced Program:
- **Sets:** 4-6
- **Reps:** 10-15+ or weighted variations
- **Weight:** Added weight plates or weighted vest
- **Rest:** 3-4 minutes between sets
- **Focus:** Advanced variations and heavy loading

## ⚠️ Safety Notes

- **Warm up thoroughly** - shoulder and elbow mobility is crucial
- **Don't descend too deep** - stop when shoulders are slightly below elbows
- **Keep elbows close** - flaring elbows increases injury risk
- **Control the movement** - avoid bouncing at the bottom
- **Build gradually** - progress slowly to prevent overuse injuries
- **Listen to your shoulders** - stop if you feel impingement or pain
- **Use assistance when needed** - don't compromise form for reps
