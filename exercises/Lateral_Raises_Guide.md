**Difficulty:** Beginner | **Type:** Strength | **Primary:** Shoulders

**Step-by-Step Technique:**
1. **Setup:** Stand with feet shoulder-width apart. This provides a stable base. Keep a slight bend in your knees for balance
2. **Hold a dumbbell in each hand:** Your arms should hang down by your sides with your palms facing your body (neutral grip). The dumbbells should be close to your thighs
3. **Engage your core:** Tighten your abdominal muscles to maintain a stable torso throughout the movement
4. **Execution:** Begin the movement by raising your arms out to the sides until they are at shoulder height. Keep a slight bend in your elbows to reduce stress on your joints. Your palms should face the floor as you lift the weights
5. **Control the movement:** Lift the weights in a controlled manner, avoiding momentum or swinging. Focus on using your lateral deltoid muscles to lift the weights
6. **Pause briefly at the top:** Once your arms reach shoulder height, pause for a brief moment. Ensure your shoulders are level and your body remains still
7. **Lower the dumbbells slowly:** Lower the weights back to the starting position in a controlled manner. Maintain the slight bend in your elbows and avoid letting the dumbbells drop quickly

1. **Setup:** Attach a single handle to the low pulley of a cable machine. Select an appropriate weight

4. **Support:** Keep your free hand on your knee or a stable surface for support
5. **Executing the Lateral Raise:** Inhale and brace your core. With a slight bend in your elbow, raise your arm across your body and out to the side until it is level with the ground
6. **Top Position:** Your palm should face downward or slightly backward at the top of the movement. Focus on lifting with your shoulder and not using your back or arms to swing the weight
7. **Holding the Position:** Hold the raised position for a brief count to maximize the contraction in your rear deltoids
8. **Returning to Starting Position:** Exhale and slowly lower your arm back to the starting position in a controlled manner, maintaining tension on the muscle throughout the movement
9. **Switching Sides:** Complete the desired number of repetitions for one side, then switch sides and repeat the exercise with the other arm
